Positrons are emitted by Flouride-18 and used in commercial imaging for patients. Positronium is an analogue to hydrogen atom where the proton is substituted by a positron. Choose a coordinate system of your choice and a) Write down the non-relativistic Hamiltonian for positronium, b) Sketch a qualitative distribution of positronic and electronic wavefunctions, and c) Will this system be stable? If so, derive a formula for its energy levels. (10 pts)\n0.2 For a hydrogen atom with only 3 hydrogenic basis functions \u0026mdash; 1s, 2s, 2p$_x$ \u0026mdash; write down the 1-electron, 2-electron, and 3-electron Hilbert-space basis functions. Assuming that the hydrogenic basis functions are orthogonal, show that the 2-electron Hilbert-space basis functions are also orthogonal. (5 pts)\n0.3 If the uknown nuclear-electron wavefunction is expressed as: $$\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{R}) = \\sum_{k=1,2;i=1,2,3,4} \\chi_k^i (\\mathbf R) \\Psi_k(\\mathbf{r};\\mathbf{R}) $$ where $\\Psi_k(\\mathbf{r};\\mathbf{R})$ are eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}^{el}$. For the cases of (i) Exact solution, (ii) Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and (iii) Adiabatic approximation, what is the matrix equation dimensionality that one needs to solve to obtain the nuclear wavefunctions $\\chi_k^i(\\mathbf R)$.For block diagonal matrices, provide the dimensions of individual blocks. Note that the index $i$ provides additional flexibility to the nuclear wavefunction, you may consider $i$ to represent different vibrational levels for a given electronic level $k$. (5 pts)\nAddendum to 0.3: You can assume that $$\\chi_k^i (\\mathbf R) = c_k^i \\phi^i(\\mathbf R),$$ where $\\phi^i(\\mathbf R)$ are another set of nuclear wavefunctions, but their functional forms are known and they form a orthonormal set (for example Harmonic oscillator basis functions). This set does not carry the index $k$, and the $k$-dependence is carried over to the unknown expansion coefficients $c_k^i$. Now, what is matrix equation dimension that is required for solving for $c_k^i$ for the three situations discussed above. (The answers will be same as before)\n","date":1548288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548288000,"objectID":"f304197ae63798c2663f0383de1e5661","permalink":"https://vkvoora.github.io/teaching/assignments/0/","publishdate":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/assignments/0/","section":"teaching","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":" ","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"An understanding of one-electron properties, such as electron affinities or ionization potentials, in a many-body system is directly relevant to the fields of catalysis, solar energy capture and redox chemical reactions. Theoretical methods that can describe ionization processes with an accuracy of 0.1 eV are necessary to be considered reliable for tailoring molecular properties. In addition, the methods need to be amenable to modern computers for studying large chemical systems with hundreds of atoms. Similarly, there is a need to account for environmental factors such as neighboring molecule effects, bias effects and vibrational dynamics that affect electron binding and transport properties. To these ends the group will work on implementing various chemical models based on Green\u0026rsquo;s function methods and generalized Koopmans\u0026rsquo; theorem. The developed methods, for example, will be used in conjunction with liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopies to understand the impact of solvation on one-electron properties.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"997a4170637743d180a7374cb2b1e461","permalink":"https://vkvoora.github.io/project/ips/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ips/","section":"project","summary":"Theoretical tools for recent advances in photoelectron spectroscopy","tags":["Quantum chemistry"],"title":"Fast computation of ionization potentials","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With looming materials challenges and development of materials with unforeseen properties/uses, it is imperative to understand the physical and chemical mechanism underlying such materials. This can, in-turn, lead to valuable new design principles. However, the current theoretical tools for material characterization suffer from lack of universal accuracy: methods often tend to describe one property well but fail at the other. For example, in materials chemistry, it is important to describe adsorption energies as well as surface energies in the same footing. We will therefore develop theoretical tools that can help describe multiple chemical properties and enable new design principles. The method development will be based on a response-theory type formalism called Adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem (ACFDT). The simplest approximation within ACFDT, called Random Phase approximation, for example, has been successful in predicting multiple properties of molecules and materials at a reasonable accuracy and computational cost. We will therefore develop methods based on ACFDT to study interlayer interactions in layered materials, adsorption energies of molecules on layered materials, encapsulation energies of small molecules, etc.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2ff9cdcb860b60732d3849e572838e86","permalink":"https://vkvoora.github.io/project/predictive-methods/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/predictive-methods/","section":"project","summary":"Response-theory based method development.","tags":["Quantum chemistry"],"title":"Predictive theories for extended systems","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adeayo Ajala","Vamsee K.

The triphenol precursor, (Ad,MeArOH)3mes, reacts with the Ln3+ amides, Ln(NR2)3 (R = SiMe3), to form a series of [((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln] complexes, 1-Ln. Crystallographic characterization was achieved for Ln = Nd, Gd, Dy, and Er. The complexes 1-Ln can be reduced with potassium graphite in the presence of 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) to form highly absorbing solutions with properties consistent with Ln2+ complexes, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln], 2-Ln. The synthesis of the Nd2+ complex [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Nd], 2-Nd, was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In the case of the other lanthanides, crystals were found to contain mixtures of 2-Ln co-crystallized with either a Ln3+ hydride complex, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)LnH], 3-Ln, for Ln = Gd, Dy, and Er, or a hydroxide complex, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln(OH)], 4-Ln, for Ln = Dy. A Dy2+ complex with 18-crown-6 as the potassium chelator, [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Dy], 5-Dy, was isolated as a co-crystallized mixture with the Dy3+ hydride complex, [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)DyH], 6-Dy. Structural comparisons of 1-Ln and 2-Ln are presented with respect to their uranium analogs and correlated with density functional theory calculations on their electronic structures.","tags":null,"title":"Comparisons of lanthanide/actinide +2 ions in a tris(aryloxide)arene coordination environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guo P.
