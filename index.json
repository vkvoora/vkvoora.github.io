This can, in-turn, lead to valuable new design principles. However, the current theoretical tools for material characterization suffer from lack of universal accuracy: methods often tend to describe one property well but fail at the other. For example, in materials chemistry, it is important to describe adsorption energies as well as surface energies in the same footing. We will therefore develop theoretical tools that can help describe multiple chemical properties and enable new design principles. The method development will be based on a response-theory type formalism called Adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem (ACFDT). The simplest approximation within ACFDT, called Random Phase approximation, for example, has been successful in predicting multiple properties of molecules and materials at a reasonable accuracy and computational cost. We will therefore develop methods based on ACFDT to study interlayer interactions in layered materials, adsorption energies of molecules on layered materials, encapsulation energies of small molecules, etc.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2ff9cdcb860b60732d3849e572838e86","permalink":"/project/predictive-methods/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/predictive-methods/","section":"project","summary":"Response-theory based method development.","tags":["Quantum chemistry"],"title":"Predictive theories for extended systems","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adeayo Ajala","Vamsee K.
