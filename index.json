Here, we extend the scope of GKS-spRPA correlated one-particle energies from frontier-orbital ionization to core orbital ionization energies, which are notoriously difficult for GW and other response methods due to strong orbital relaxation effects. For a benchmark consisting of 23 1s core electron binding energies (CEBEs) of second-row elements, chemical shifts estimated from GKS-spRPA one-particle energies yield mean absolute deviations from experiment of 0.2 eV, which are significantly more accurate than the standard GW and comparable to Δ self-consistent field theory without semiempirical adjustment of the energy functional. For small ammonia clusters and cytosine tautomers, GKS-spRPA based chemical shifts capture subtle variations in covalent and noncovalent bonding environments; GKS-spRPA 1s CEBEs for these systems agree with equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles and ADC(4) results within 0.2–0.3 eV. Two perturbative approximations to GKS-spRPA orbital energies, which reduce the scaling from O(N6) to O(N5) and O(N4), are introduced and tested. We illustrate the application of GKS-spRPA orbital energies to larger systems by using oxygen 1s CEBEs to probe solvation and packing effects in condensed phases of water. GKS-spRPA predicts a lowering of the oxygen 1s CEBE of approximately 1.6–1.7 eV in solid and liquid phases, consistent with liquid-jet X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and gas phase cluster experiments. The results are rationalized by partitioning GKS-spRPA electron binding energies into static, relaxation, and correlation parts.

Crystallographic characterization was achieved for Ln = Nd, Gd, Dy, and Er. The complexes 1-Ln can be reduced with potassium graphite in the presence of 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) to form highly absorbing solutions with properties consistent with Ln2+ complexes, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln], 2-Ln. The synthesis of the Nd2+ complex [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Nd], 2-Nd, was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In the case of the other lanthanides, crystals were found to contain mixtures of 2-Ln co-crystallized with either a Ln3+ hydride complex, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)LnH], 3-Ln, for Ln = Gd, Dy, and Er, or a hydroxide complex, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln(OH)], 4-Ln, for Ln = Dy.

Decades of intensive research has also resulted in a large variety of methods that often confounds the users. However, they all fall under two main class of methods: wavefunction based and density function based methods. A fundamental understanding of these methods can aid researchers and practitioners of this field. To this end, this course aims to\nunderstand the approximations that go into various quantum chemistry methods develop a quantitative understanding of chemical binding; aspects of covalent and non-covalent bonding will be covered. develop means to analyze the results of electronic structure methods, and be able to assess their use in their own routine research.
