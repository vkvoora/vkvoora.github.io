The triphenol precursor, (Ad,MeArOH)3mes, reacts with the Ln3+ amides, Ln(NR2)3 (R = SiMe3), to form a series of [((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln] complexes, 1-Ln. Crystallographic characterization was achieved for Ln = Nd, Gd, Dy, and Er. The complexes 1-Ln can be reduced with potassium graphite in the presence of 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) to form highly absorbing solutions with properties consistent with Ln2+ complexes, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln], 2-Ln. The synthesis of the Nd2+ complex [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Nd], 2-Nd, was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In the case of the other lanthanides, crystals were found to contain mixtures of 2-Ln co-crystallized with either a Ln3+ hydride complex, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)LnH], 3-Ln, for Ln = Gd, Dy, and Er, or a hydroxide complex, [K(crypt)][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Ln(OH)], 4-Ln, for Ln = Dy. A Dy2+ complex with 18-crown-6 as the potassium chelator, [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)Dy], 5-Dy, was isolated as a co-crystallized mixture with the Dy3+ hydride complex, [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2][((Ad,MeArO)3mes)DyH], 6-Dy. Structural comparisons of 1-Ln and 2-Ln are presented with respect to their uranium analogs and correlated with density functional theory calculations on their electronic structures.","tags":null,"title":"Comparisons of lanthanide/actinide +2 ions in a tris(aryloxide)arene coordination environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guo P.

Theoretical methods that can describe ionization processes with an accuracy of 0.1 eV are necessary to be considered reliable for tailoring molecular properties. In addition, the methods need to be amenable to modern computers for studying large chemical systems with hundreds of atoms. Similarly, there is a need to account for environmental factors such as neighboring molecule effects, bias effects and vibrational dynamics that affect one-electron properties. To these ends the group will work on implementing various chemical models based on Green\u0026rsquo;s function methods and generalized Koopmans\u0026rsquo; theorem.
